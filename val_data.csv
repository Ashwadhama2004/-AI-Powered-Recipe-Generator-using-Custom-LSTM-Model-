minutes or until frosting is smooth and creamy, turn cake out of the pan onto wax paper, using both hands, carefully flip the cake over, so that its rightsideup, onto another strip of wax paper, now

other words, itll make your family say wow, youre great dad, so on fathers day, why not go to the kitchen in the afternoon and make these, if youve decided to go for it, for this day women are forbidden to enter the kitchen, whatever happens you, dad, must take care of it yourself, i finally got everyone to sit at the dinner table and try the dumplings, they kept on exclaiming how hot they were, and i was filled with a sense of accomplishment, theres nothing you cant do, just have fun, learning how to make these is really not a big deal, its not difficult at all, so, lets get started, start with the prep work, rip up the stick of kanten, put it into the oolong tea, and soak it until it has softened, heat the tea and kanten until the kanten dissolves, once thats done, well make the
